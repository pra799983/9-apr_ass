    "Here's a step-by-step description of how the decision tree classifier algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm requires a labeled dataset, where each instance has a set of features and a corresponding class or target value.\n",
    "The features should be in a structured format, such as numerical or categorical variables.\n",
    "Tree construction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm selects the best feature to split the data at the root of the tree. The \"best\" feature is chosen based on criteria like information \n",
    "gain, Gini index, or other measures that quantify the purity or impurity of the data.\n",
    "The selected feature becomes the root node of the tree, and the data is partitioned into subsets based on the possible values of that feature.\n",
    "The process is recursively repeated for each subset, creating child nodes and splitting the data based on the best features in each subset.\n",
    "The recursion continues until a stopping criterion is met. This criterion could be reaching a maximum depth, a minimum number of instances per leaf,\n",
    "or other defined conditions.\n",
    "Tree pruning (optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "After constructing the initial tree, pruning techniques can be applied to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.\n",
    "Pruning involves removing nodes or branches from the tree based on criteria like the error rate, cost-complexity, or cross-validation performance.\n",
    "Prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions, a new instance is passed through the decision tree, following the learned rules and conditions.\n",
    "At each node, the instance's feature values determine which branch to follow.\n",
    "The prediction is based on the majority class or the predicted value of the instances that reach a leaf node.\n",
    "The decision tree classifier algorithm is intuitive and interpretable since it represents decisions in a hierarchical structure. It can handle both \n",
    "categorical and numerical features, and it can capture complex non-linear relationships in the data. However, decision trees are prone to overfitting\n",
